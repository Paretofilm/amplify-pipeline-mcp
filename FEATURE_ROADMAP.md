# ðŸš€ Pipeline MCP Feature Roadmap

## Current Features âœ…
- [x] Basic pipeline setup
- [x] Auto-fix system for deployment errors
- [x] Webhook creation for frontend builds
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow generation
- [x] Automatic branch detection

## Priority 1: Essential Features ðŸ”´

### 1. Multi-Environment Support
**Why:** Most apps need dev/staging/prod environments
```python
pipeline_deploy app_id="..." environment="staging"
```
**Implementation:**
- Add environment parameter to pipeline_deploy
- Create branch mapping (mainâ†’prod, developâ†’staging)
- Generate environment-specific workflows
- Separate secrets per environment

### 2. Test Integration
**Why:** Prevent broken code from deploying
```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: |
    npm test -- --coverage
    npm run test:e2e
```
**Implementation:**
- Add test step before deployment
- Support coverage thresholds
- Block deployment on test failure
- Generate test reports

### 3. Build Caching
**Why:** 30-50% faster builds
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      .next/cache
      node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

## Priority 2: Developer Experience ðŸŸ¡

### 4. Notifications
**Why:** Instant feedback on deployments
```python
pipeline_deploy app_id="..." notify_slack="https://hooks.slack.com/..."
```
**Features:**
- Slack/Discord integration
- Email notifications
- Custom webhooks
- Rich formatting with error details

### 5. Performance Monitoring
**Why:** Prevent performance regressions
```yaml
- name: Check Bundle Size
  run: |
    npm run build:analyze
    if [ $(stat -f%z .next) -gt 5000000 ]; then
      echo "Bundle too large!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 6. Rollback Capability
**Why:** Quick recovery from bad deployments
```python
pipeline_rollback app_id="..." to_version="previous"
```
**Features:**
- One-command rollback
- Automatic backup of outputs
- Git revert integration
- Database migration rollback

## Priority 3: Advanced Features ðŸŸ¢

### 7. Security Scanning
**Why:** Prevent security vulnerabilities
```yaml
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    npm audit --audit-level=high
    npx snyk test
    git secrets --scan
```

### 8. Deployment Analytics
**Why:** Track and improve deployment metrics
```python
pipeline_stats app_id="..." period="30d"
```
**Metrics:**
- Deployment frequency
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Failed deployment reasons

### 9. PR Preview Environments
**Why:** Test changes before merging
```python
pipeline_preview pr_number="123"
```
**Features:**
- Temporary environments for PRs
- Automatic cleanup after merge
- Comment with preview URL

### 10. Cost Optimization
**Why:** Reduce AWS costs
```python
pipeline_optimize app_id="..."
```
**Features:**
- Identify unused resources
- Suggest cost-saving changes
- Schedule-based scaling
- Automatic cleanup of old builds

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Week 1-2**: Multi-environment + Test integration
2. **Week 3-4**: Build caching + Notifications
3. **Week 5-6**: Performance monitoring + Rollback
4. **Week 7-8**: Security + Analytics
5. **Week 9-10**: PR previews + Cost optimization

## Quick Wins (Can implement now)

### A. Parallel Jobs
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # runs in parallel with lint
  
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # runs in parallel with test
  
  deploy:
    needs: [test, lint]
    # only runs after both succeed
```

### B. Matrix Builds
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [16, 18, 20]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
```

### C. Conditional Deployments
```yaml
if: |
  github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 
  !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip-deploy]')
```

### D. Artifact Uploads
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: coverage/
```

### E. Dependency Caching
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: package-lock.json
```

## How to Contribute

1. Pick a feature from the roadmap
2. Create a branch: `feature/add-{feature-name}`
3. Update `server.py` with new functionality
4. Add tests in `test_{feature}.py`
5. Update README with new feature docs
6. Submit PR with examples

## Feature Request Template

```markdown
## Feature: [Name]

### Problem
What problem does this solve?

### Solution
How should it work?

### Example Usage
```python
pipeline_deploy app_id="..." new_feature="value"
```

### Implementation Notes
- Technical considerations
- Dependencies needed
- Potential challenges
```

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of projects using each feature
- **Time Saved**: Reduction in deployment time
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer failed deployments
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Feedback and usage patterns

## Notes

- All features should maintain backward compatibility
- Each feature should be optional (don't break existing setups)
- Features should be well-documented with examples
- Consider AWS costs for each feature
- Prioritize based on user feedback and usage data
